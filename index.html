		<p>Policies can lead to inequalities because it could widely influenced for other people and see another race as an enemy.  Evidence: In September of 1865, Former Slave Henry Adams asked his boss to go to the city of Shreveport, Louisiana.  Then he told his boss that he wouldn't carry a pass because he is a free and there is not reason to.  Until he got surrounded by four white men, he told them he didn't belong to anybody expecting that everyone was free, but they struck him with a stick and said, " We are were going to kill you and every other Negro who told us that they didn't belong to anyone."  They let him out free and went back to Shreveport.  Evidence 2:  Adams also witnessed that during the same week the boss's wife whipped a 15 year old African American girl two days in a row nearly to death.  There were numerous whippings and people decided to escape out of Shreveport.  Reasoning: This evidence supports my claim because the white people and slave owners before  thought it was normalized to enslave African Americans and saw them as non-human and treated them harshly.  The current events that relate are the black lives matter movement focusing on modern prejudice that our society needs to reflect on.
Source: Former slave Henry Adams made this statement before the US Senate in 1880 about the early days of his freedom after civil war.</p>
